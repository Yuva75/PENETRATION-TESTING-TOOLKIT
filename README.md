Description of this Task

A Penetration Testing Toolkit is a collection of automated scripts and utilities designed to assist ethical hackers and security professionals in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications. Written in Python, this toolkit combines multiple offensive security techniques under one framework, making it easy to conduct reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting â€” all from a single interface.
This Python-based toolkit is modular, allowing each component to focus on a specific phase of the penetration testing lifecycle. The toolkit helps simulate real-world attacks in a safe and controlled manner, enabling organizations to assess the strength of their security posture and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

#Core Modules and Features

Information Gathering:

-Perform WHOIS lookups
-DNS enumeration
-Subdomain brute-forcing
-Banner grabbing
-Port scanning (using raw sockets or wrappers like Nmap)

Web Application Scanning:

-Detect common web vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF)
-Analyze HTTP headers
-Crawl web pages and extract endpoints
-Test for insecure login pages or admin panels

Network Scanning:

-Discover live hosts
-Perform TCP/UDP port scans
-Identify open services and operating systems

Password Attacks:

-Brute-force login pages (HTTP Basic/Auth, SSH, FTP, etc.)
-Dictionary-based password testing
-Custom wordlist generation

Exploitation:

-Inject payloads for testing vulnerable endpoints
-Test common exploits like command injection, file inclusion, or misconfigurations
-Integrate with Metasploit or exploit-db via CLI wrappers

Reporting:

-Log all findings in structured reports (HTML, JSON, or text)
-Summarize vulnerabilities with severity levels and remediation tips

Use Cases:

-Ethical hacking
-Red team assessments
-Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions
-Cybersecurity education and training
-Automated internal network auditing

# Legal Note:
This toolkit is intended for educational and authorized penetration testing only. Unauthorized use against systems without consent is illegal and strictly prohibited.
